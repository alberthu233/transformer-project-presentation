Now please only generate a high quality rewrite prompt for my model for this task: {aspect_name}. As described here {aspect_description} The prompt should be creative, clear, specific, and consistent in format. For example, if your prompt involve in a certain Genre, be specific on genre, an don't be vague in the prompt. It should cover a diverse range of topics and styles. Avoid bias and ensure the prompt is generalizable. You will not be given the original text, so your prompt should be applicable to any input text. Dont leave any blank spaces or leave a [ ] that I will need to fill in later in the prompt. The prompt should be a full sentence. Limit the prompt to 30 words. Please do not include any special characters or symbols in the prompt.\"\n",

Your sentence must be imaginative, precise, and detailed, avoiding ambiguity and generalities. It should not only fit within a 30-word limit but also be versatile enough to apply to a wide variety of texts. Specify the genre or style directly when relevant, and ensure the sentence is clear and engaging without requiring further customization or the inclusion of brackets or placeholders. Create a standalone sentence that embodies all these criteria, making sure it's free from any special characters or symbols. Thanks!\"\n",
